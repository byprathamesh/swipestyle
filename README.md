## Tips for Staying Free & Maximizing Potential

- **Monitor Free Tier Limits:** Keep a close watch on usage dashboards for services like Supabase, Vercel, and Netlify to avoid unexpected costs. Understand the limitations of their free offerings.
- **Optimize Media:** Compress images and videos to save on storage and bandwidth. Consider client-side image resizing before uploads.
- **Explore Open-Source AI:** For long-term AI features, investigate open-source models (e.g., from Hugging Face) that you might be able to self-host or integrate, as free credits on proprietary services may expire.
- **Leverage Community:** Engage your users for feedback, beta testing, and potentially contributions if you open-source components.
- **Lean Feature Development:** Prioritize core features to manage complexity and resource consumption effectively.
- **Implement Caching:** Use caching strategies (CDN, server, client-side) to improve performance and reduce load on backend services, helping you stay within free tier limits.
