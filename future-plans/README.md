# Future Plans & Non-MVP Features

This directory is a holding area for features, code snippets, and ideas that are not part of the current MVP scope but may be considered for future development.

## Identified Non-MVP Features/Code (Moved or Noted Here):

- **Basic Messaging Feature:**
  - A placeholder endpoint `app.post('/messages', ...)` was initially present in `backend/server.js`.
  - This feature is not part of the defined MVP and the endpoint has been removed from the active backend code.
  - Future implementation would involve real-time or asynchronous messaging capabilities between users, potentially for discussing swaps.

(Add other features or code references here as they are identified and deferred.)
